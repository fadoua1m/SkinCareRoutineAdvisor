Expert System for Personalized Routine Recommendations
A smart system designed to provide personalized recommendations for skincare routines based on user input. It analyzes answers to a series of questions related to skin and health conditions and suggests suitable products or routines tailored to individual needs.

Features
Personalized Skincare Routines: Recommends routines based on the user's skin condition, type, and concerns.
Questionnaire-Based Input: Users answer a series of questions to provide insight into their skin or health, which is used to generate personalized recommendations.
Product Recommendations: Based on responses, the system recommends skincare products suited to each user.
Fallback Message: If no suitable routine matches the criteria, the system suggests consulting a dermatologist.
Technologies Used
Python: For the backend logic and expert system rule-based engine.
Flask/Django (or other frameworks): For serving the expert system and user interaction.
HTML/CSS: For the user interface (UI), designed to provide a seamless experience.
JavaScript: For dynamic user interactions (optional, based on your frontend choice).

Fallback: If no routine fits, the system displays a message advising users to consult a dermatologist.
