# SkinCareRoutineAdvisor
An intelligent expert system that provides personalized routine recommendations based on user input, helping users find the best products and actions for their skin or health needs.

## Features
- Personalized Skincare Routines: Recommends routines based on the user's skin condition, type, and concerns.
- Questionnaire-Based Input: Users answer a series of questions to provide insight into their skin or health, which is used to generate personalized recommendations.
- Product Recommendations: Based on responses, the system recommends skincare products suited to each user.
- Fallback Message: If no suitable routine matches the criteria, the system suggests consulting a dermatologist.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For the backend logic and expert system rule-based engine.
- **Flask/Django (or other frameworks)**: For serving the expert system and user interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the user interface (UI), designed to provide a seamless experience.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic user interactions (optional, based on your frontend choice).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    For example, if you're using Flask:
    ```bash
    cd repository-name
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

Visit the app in your browser:
    ```bash
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user is prompted with questions about their skin condition, type, and other concerns.
2. **Decision Logic**: The system matches the responses to predefined rules stored in a knowledge base.
3. **Routine Generation**: If matching criteria are found, the system suggests a customized routine, including skincare products or routines tailored to the userâ€™s needs.
4. **Fallback**: If no routine fits, the system displays a message advising users to consult a dermatologist.
